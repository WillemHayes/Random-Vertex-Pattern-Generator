# Random-Vertex-Pattern-Generator
This project is a pattern generation tool that lets you create designs with a random number of random shapes.

## Examples

## Technologies Used
This project was made in p5.js.

## Link to Sketch
(https://editor.p5js.org/WillemHayes/sketches/uUtq7oOJl)

## Usage
By changing the colours, shape number parameters, vertices parameters and x/y parameters, you have a lot of control over the kinds of shapes this sketch can generate.
Blending modes such as multiply can be applied too which can result in interesting effects.

## Limitations
This is my first full project using p5.js so the scope of this project is pretty small. However, the project works and was an effective learning experience, and can create some cool designs.
