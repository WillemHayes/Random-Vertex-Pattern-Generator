# Random-Vertex-Pattern-Generator
This is a pattern generation tool made in p5 that lets you create a random number of random shapes.

## Examples

## Installation
Copy the code from the sketch.js file into p5.js.

## Usage
By changing the colours, shape number parameters, vertices parameters and x/y parameters, you have a lot of control over the kinds of shapes this sketch can generate.
Blending modes such as multiply can be applied too which can result in interesting effects.
